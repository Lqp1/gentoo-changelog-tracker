A script wrapping equery and Gentoo's gitweb to retrieve Changelogs

As it's not possible anymore to track Changelogs using `equery changes`, this
simple wrapper script tries to get info via Gentoo's official gitweb (RSS
feed thus it's limited to 10 entries).

I'll try to improve it in the near future.
